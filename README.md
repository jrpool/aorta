# aorta

Automated Order Router for Tests of Accessibility (Aorta).

## Introduction

This application receives orders for digital accessibility tests, routes the orders to testers, obtains the results from the testers, and delivers the results to the ordering customers. It asks you for the pages you want to test and the tests you want to perform.

## Configuration

Aorta con be configured with some environment variables. If you wish to use them and have no other mechanism for doing so, you can add an `.env.js` file to the projectâ€™s root directory with this format:

```javascript
exports.env = {
  'HOST': 'abc',
  'PORT': 3005,
  'PROTOCOL': 'def',
  'KEY': '/ghi.key',
  'CERT': '/jkl.crt'
}
```

In this example, replace:
- `abc` with `localhost` or a server URL
- `def` with `http2`, `https`, or `http`
- `ghi` with the path to a private SSH key file
- `jkl` with the path to an SSH certificate file

The `KEY` and `CERT` variables are required if the value of the `PROTOCOL` variable is `http2` or `https`.

## Testers

The testers can be humans or machines.

## Orders

The application requires that orders for tests be compatible with [Testaro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro). This means that an order specifies a script, and optionally a batch. The script and batch must comply with Testaro rules for scripts and batches.

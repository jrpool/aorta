Automated Opensource Routines for Testing Accessibility (AORTA).

## Introduction

This application tests web pages for accessibility. It asks you for the pages you want to test and the tests you want to perform. Then it uses the [Testaro package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro) to perform the tests and make reports of the results available to you.
